In this assignment you need to program a simple subscribers repository with the following functionality:
Clarifications:

DB is this assignment means saving data in the memory using a model like we did in class (no need for a real DB), all the data will be erased when we close the app.

All screens need to be implemented using Activities, each screen in a separate Activity.

List must be implemented using a RecyclerView.


The program will have 4 screens:

Students List

New Student

Student details

Edit Student


The Student list presents the complete list of students. each row will present the student pic, name, id and checkbox that mark the check status of the student. pressing the check button will change the check status of that student. pressing on a row will open the student details screen.


Add New Student adds a new student to the database. for now you don't need to select the pic from the gallery or the camera, just present a static pic that you add to the project (all students will have the same picture)


Student details - presents the details of a selected student from the list.


Edit student - update or delete a given student - all values can be updated! (even the student ID). make sure your database is updated correctly.
